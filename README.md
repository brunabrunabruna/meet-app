Meet App 📍
Objective

To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.
Serverless

Going serverless for this project will help it be set up faster, saving a lot of time, as well as enabling it to easily scale in the future, if necessary. My serverless functions implementation will be made using AWS Lambda, in combination with an external Google Calendar API, and will also handle the OAuth verification.
